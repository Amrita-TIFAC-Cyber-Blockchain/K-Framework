## Overview and Key terms

- A **K file** (with .k extension) consists of one or more **requires or modules.**
- **Each module** consists of one or more **imports or sentences.**
- K's compiler is called **kompile,** compiles it into an interpreter
- A set of K files that are compiled together are called a **K definition.**
- **krun** will use the interpreter generated by the first call to kompile to execute this program.
- A **rule** begins with the _rule_ keyword and contains at least one rewrite operator (**=>**). 
- K's grammar is divided into two components:
  - the outer syntax of K (predetermined): parsing of requires, modules, imports, and sentences in a K definition. 
  - the inner syntax of K (defined by you, the developer): parsing of rules and programs.
